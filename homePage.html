<h1>Home Page</h1>

<p>Welcome to the home page of our final project. Information displayed here
  is a representation of what information *could* have been displayed if we had
  relevant data. This however, is a representation of mock JSON files that contain
  information about purchases, price of items, and what items are most popular
</p>

<p>
  Again, this information serves no real connection between real data tailored to
  customer purchase information.
