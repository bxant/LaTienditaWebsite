  This project is a representation of mock information. This information is in no way
  accurate to an actual retailer. The goal of this assignment was to be able to display information
  to users about being able to view data, display stats about items, make a *fake* purchase, and view cats

<ul>
  <li>
<a routerLink="/Cats">Cats!</a>
  </li>
  <li>
<a routerLink="/Near">Make Purchase</a>
  </li>
  <li>
  <a routerLink = "/StatsPage">Statistics</a>
</li>


<router-outlet></router-outlet>
