Details about our project:

The information displayed on this website/project are not at all accurate to a real retail/e-commerce site.
This information is mock information made from Pablo Ramirez. This data is all mock data, and not at all
real. This is only to present users with the ability to make purchases in a store.

Pages in our project:

SHOP:

Shop page is the dedicated home page of our mock website. This page is mainly for users to add items
to their cart. Users are able to filter by price, type of item, and number of items displayed.


STATISTICS:

STATISTICS page is dedicated to displaying information related to the mock data in our shop.
A user can choose to filter by the type of product they want to view. The viewing of this information
is only number of items in stock. And the amount of sales they have made.

MAKE PURCHASE:

Make purchase page is dedicated to the "cart" that a user filled up when adding to their cart.
They can remove items from their cart as well as finalizing their purchases.
Once these purchases are made, the STATISTICS page is updated with stock number decrease, and sales
increase.
